What is OpenHEP about?

There is a long history of publishing computer code used in high energy physics (HEP). It is published in specialized journals, on online platforms such as [HepForge](https://www.hepforge.org/) or on researchers' WWW pages. However, in most of these cases, the code itself is considered as a sort of "publication" - it is an elaborate, documented project expected to be used by others in a wide range of applications.

On the other hand, large fraction of today's HEP research involves some sort of computer coding, and results of a given paper can be difficult to reproduce without having access to this code. Authors rarely (never, one might say) publish this code because it is often just a collection of ad hoc scripts and notebooks, poorly structured and not documented. Even so, this code would be a valuable resource to other researchers, and if authors took a small additional effort to put it online, the usefulness of their research would significantly increase and the whole field could benefit.

If you agree, and want to support open and reproducible HEP, consider publishing code used in production of your paper. If you publish it here on GitHub, you may want to consider transfering your repository to this OpenHEP GitHub "organization". Having a collection of such repositories will maybe increase visibility of each one, and will surely help the whole "open HEP" idea.
